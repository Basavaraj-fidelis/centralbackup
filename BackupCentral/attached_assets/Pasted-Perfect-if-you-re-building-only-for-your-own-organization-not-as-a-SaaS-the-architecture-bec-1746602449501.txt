Perfect â€” if you're building **only for your own organization**, not as a SaaS, the architecture becomes much simpler, more secure, and tailored.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of **Additional Features** that are ideal for an **internal Duplicati dashboard**:

### âœ… **Internal-Only Dashboard Features (non-SaaS)**

#### 1. **Machine Inventory**
- Show a list of all systems with Duplicati agents.
- Display metadata: hostname, IP, OS, last backup time.

#### 2. **Backup Job History**
- View all backup runs per machine.
- Show time, duration, backup size, and result (Success/Warning/Error).
- Filter by date, status, or machine.

#### 3. **Centralized Success Rate & Stats**
- Show:
  - % success rate (past 7/30/90 days)
  - Total backup jobs
  - Total failed/successful jobs
  - Total data backed up
- Can be presented with charts.

#### 4. **Alert Center**
- Highlight:
  - Jobs that failed
  - Machines not reporting for X hours/days
  - Warnings (e.g., partial backup)

#### 5. **Notification System (Optional)**

### Next Step:
Would you like me to give you a **project scaffold** (API + frontend UI + database models) that replicates this internal dashboard so you can deploy it via Replit or locally?
